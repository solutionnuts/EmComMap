EmComMap Overview
=================

As digital modes become more pervasive for emergency communications, we can begin using more
advanced operating methods. Additionally, software advances make user interaction within the
browser more functional. These advances include interactive maps and sync-able browser-side
databases. EmComMap leverages these technologies to enable shared, map-based situational
awareness part of emergency communications.

Briefly, EmComMap provides an internet-based communicator designed for emergency
communications. It focuses on a map of the incident area, and allows users to specify locations related
to messages and operators. It provides functionality typical of Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)
operation, such as specifying traffic precedence and exporting traffic logs. Additionally, it acts as a
convenient way to collect and summarize information about specific locations. It is intended for use
either as a method to accumulate situational awareness (for example, used by a net control operator),
or as a primary communication platform over mesh.
